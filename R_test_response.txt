1.Import the sales data into R
R script

2.Create a plot of sales, TV investment and Digital investment
sales_vs_investments.png saved to directory as specified by 'my_dir'

3.Report the correlations among Sales, TV and Digital investment
The correlation between Sales and Digital Investment being 0.66 is the most significant and the 
correlation between Sales and TV Investment being 0.44 is a bit less significant.
On the other hand there is little correlation between TV Investment and Digital Investment.

4.Fit a regression model to data
R script

4a.Report on the adjusted R-squared
The adjusted R-squared value of 0.5586161 suggests that the model can explain about 56% of the 
variance in the Sales value can be explained by the regressors. 
The regression model is of some value but there are still some unexplained variances. 
A plot of the residuals shows a trend of increasing residuals with some seasonality.

4b.Report the p-value and significance of each regressor
The p values of the intercept is 6.72e-7 and 
the p value of the digital spend is 1.62e-4 and 
the p value of the TV spend is 9.75e-3. 
They are all less than 0.05 and hence all regressors are highly significant so that it is quite unlikely that 
the sales value is not correlated with these regressors with the likelihoods being the respective p values.

5.Calculate the contribution from TV Spend to sales in % and absolute dollar value
As computed in the R script the contribution from TV spend is around 16.6%.
In absolute dollar value the contribution from TV spend is $44,108,224

6.Calculate the TV return on investment (ROI)
The TV ROI = (TV_contribution - TV_investment) / TV_investment 
		   = (44108224 - 25473374) / 25473374 
		   = 0.7315423

7.Using the planned spend values for the first 3 months of 2018 and your regressions model, 
	calculate the expected sales value for the first 3 months of 2018
The expected sales values for the first 3 months of 2018 are 8334056, 9082486 and 10892394

8.In your opinion what additional data would improve your model and why?
Firstly the overall economic performance and the trends and seasonality of the industry would be of interest as 
the individual company's performance would be affected by the environment/economic factors. 
From the dataset there seems to be a trend of growth with seasonality effects during Christmas period.
Furthermore if there are other marketing media being used besides TV and digital, those should be taken into account as well.
More importantly the number of distributors, pricing and promotions and the competitor's prices would all be 
possible additional regressors as these factors would influence the consumers' behaviour.
